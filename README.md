Promises are awesome. But when it comes to write promise chains, it becomes kind of hard to write.
PQ solves this issue and allows you to create **human readable promise chains**

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/pquery.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/pquery)

## Install

```
npm install pquery --save
```

## Overview

**What you write:**
```js
var query = "(name, surname) of users of @json"

pq(fetch("/users"), query).then(...)
```

**This is actually what you run:**
```js
fetch("/users").
  then(function () {
    return response.json()
  }).
  then(function (response) {
    return response.users
  }).
  then(function (response) {
    return response.map(function (object) { return {
      name: object.name,
      surname: object.surname
  }})
})
```

## Why?

I use promises in many cases in my daily work. And **calling a promise chain** is a bit *boring* to write. I used to write `then` keyword to create a chain and this drive me crazy, they seem ugly.

I created **pq** to make this chains easier to write and easier to read.

Let's checkout a real-world promise example:
```js
var foo = fetch("/hello")

foo.then(function (response) {
  return response.json()
}).then(function (response) {
  return response.data
}) // this then's may go to the sky, or the hell!
```

This is how to write this using **pq**:
```js
pq(foo, "data of @json")
```

Alternatively, you can write this more human-readable or the variants you use:

```js
pq(foo, "data of @json")

// Or using `then`
pq(foo, "@json then data")

// Or using arrows...
pq(foo, "@json -> data")

// Also reversed arrows:
pq(foo, "data <- @json")
```

> You can use `of` and `then` together: `full_name of user then last_letter of first_name`. This will be run like: `(full_name of user) then (last_letter of first_name)`, which is actually `user then full_name then first_name then last_letter`. **If it becomes confusing to you, do not use them together**

## How to Write Queries

There are few simple rules to write a readable query:

### Promise Chain Keywords

`then` and `of` are main keywords to generate promise chains. `foo then bar` is actually `foo.then(function (r) { return r.bar })`. Since they are chained, the left part of chain must have the right of the chain.

`of` (reverse promise keyword) makes the query more readable. Just like the *SQL*, you define what you want at first. `bar of foo` is `foo.then(function (r) { return r.bar })`, too.

Keyword | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`.. then ` or `.. -> ..` | Simple promise chain | `@json then data`, `@json -> data`
`.. of ..` or `.. <- ..` | Simple promise chain, reversed | `data of @json`, `data <- @json`

### Meta Characters (Optional)

Meta characters are optional. But they want to make your query easier to read/write. If you want to call a function, you can just put a `@` character beginning of it. `@json` will be converted to `json()`.

The most useful meta character is `%{number}`. It allows you to pass arguments to the `pq`. `("a of %1", "b")` will be `a of b`.

Character | Description | Example | Equivalent
--- | --- | --- | ---
`@` | Method Calling | `@methodName` | `methodName()`
`%{number}` | Simple Parameters | `pq(promise, "%1 of @json", "hello")` | `pq(promise, "hello of @json")`
`&` | This Object | `&.length of users of @json` | `this.length of users of json()`
